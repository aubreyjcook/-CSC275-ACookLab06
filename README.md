Question Subject Line: CSC 275 Online Lab 6 Question

For this week's lab we will be creating two separate methods to detect if a user entered string is a palindrome. The first method should ONLY use the string class and/or character class and should compare one character at a time working from the outside in. 

The second method should use the StringBuilder class and can use any method of that class.

Note: Special characters, character case, and spaces should be ignored.

Example palindromes follow:
racecar
RaceCar
!Race Car
Ra!ceCar
